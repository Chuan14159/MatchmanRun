IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
For climbing a wall, the best method is holding the W button and switch between A and D buttons.
For example: to climb a wall on the right, you jump to the wall and hold the W button and D button, then press A button and switch back to D button as quickly as possible.
If you are between 2 walls, you can simply hold W and switch between A and D.
You will need some practice to do that.
